## Summary

In creating hands-on exercises for Computer and Information Science classes, one of the main challenges is setting up the often complex individual environment needed to conduct the exercises. Traditionally, the instructor will provide students a list of required software to install on their computers along with detailed setup instructions. Invariably, there will be some students that are unable to complete the instructions or run into a situation specific to their computer that must be handled on an individual, case-by-case basis. Troubleshooting these issues can be time consuming, and is often completed one-on-one during office hours. This scenario became even more challenging as we moved to fully online classes. It is especially hard to identify all students that are having difficulty completing their environment setup when some of them are reluctant to come forward. These students can get left behind until their set-up issues are fixed. 

These problems can be greatly reduced by using a Cloud-based environment where students receive an individual copy of the standard environment that has a uniform setup. One such option is AWS Cloud9, which is a cloud based integrated development environment (IDE) located in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. This environment can be made available to students via the AWS Educate program which provides students with credits that allow them to use the IDE and other cloud resources. The AWS Educate program also provides instructors the ability to access each student's environment, greatly simplifying the processes of assisting struggling students both during and outside of synchronous class sessions or office hours. 

This hands-on workshop is intended for instructors of computer and information science classes that have hands-on programming components. All attendees will be required to have either an AWS educate account or a personal AWS account.
